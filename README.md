# speechobot
Robot that works on IBM Watson STT API

Make this robot do things like, clap, jump, walk, dance by saying them and ask him to search for certain item for you, e.g; say 'Search apple'. Happy Playing!
    Commands it respond to:
    'Hello'       -> For a wave
    'Jump'        -> Make a jump
    'Turn'        -> Make me go round n round
    'Clap'        -> Clap my hands
    'Up'          -> Scroll page up
    'Down'        -> Scroll page down
    'Walk/Move'   -> Make me walk
    'Dance/Happy' -> Make me dance
    'Stomp'       -> Go stomp n stomp
    'Sky'         -> Show you sky
    'twitter'     -> Take you to Twitter
    'Facebook'    -> Take you to Facebook
    'Instagram'   -> Take you to Instagram
    'Git'         -> Take you to Github
    'Search/Find your_query' -> Help you with Google Search
    'Close/Clear' -> Clear my search results
For everything else I'm still learning. Can you help?
